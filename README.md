# Paris-Olympics-Power-BI-Dashboard-

## 📌 Project Overview  
The Paris Olympics Analytics Dashboard is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze historical Olympic data, focusing on medal distribution, athlete performance, gender trends, and country-wise achievements. The project demonstrates my expertise in data analytics, visualization, and storytelling, providing actionable insights into Olympic trends over the years.

## 🚀 Features  
- **Total Medals by Country** 🏆  
- **Category-wise Medal Analysis** 🥇🥈🥉  
- **Athlete Demographics (Age, Gender, Sport)**  
- **Trends Over Different Olympic Years**

## 🎯 Why I Chose This Project?
```The Olympics is a globally significant event, rich in data spanning multiple decades, making it an ideal dataset for exploring trends, patterns, and impactful insights. 

Through this project, I aimed to:
✔ Apply Power BI skills in real-world sports analytics.
✔ Showcase data versatility by working with a multi-dimensional dataset.
✔ Demonstrate DAX calculations & visual storytelling for decision-making.
✔ Enhance my data-driven approach in analyzing global sporting events.

🔍 Data Versatility & Analysis Approach
The dataset includes athlete information, sports categories, medal types, event years, and country-wise performance. 
I performed:
🔹 Data Cleaning & Transformation:
  Handled missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistent data formats.
  Standardized country names and unified medal categories.
  
🔹 Data Modeling & DAX Formulas:
  Created calculated columns and measures for total medals, athlete participation, and medal distribution using DAX.
  Applied filters, slicers, and drill-through features for deeper insights.
  
🔹 Visual Representation & Storytelling:
  Used bar charts, heatmaps, treemaps, and line charts for comparative analysis.
  Implemented interactive tooltips & slicers for an engaging experience.

📊 Key Insights from the Dashboard
🔹 Medal Trends & Country Dominance:
  Certain countries consistently dominate Olympic events across different years.
  Host countries often see an increase in medal count due to home advantage.

🔹 Athlete Demographics (Age & Gender Analysis):
  The average age of medalists varies across sports, with gymnastics favoring younger athletes and marathon events having older participants.
  The gender gap in participation has narrowed significantly over time, reflecting the progress in inclusivity.

🔹 Event & Sport-Wise Analysis:
Some sports have a higher medal distribution due to multiple event categories.
